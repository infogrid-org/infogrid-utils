/**
 * <p>A <code>Context</code> collects an "environment" of objects. One can look
 *    at it as the set of "static" variables in a C or C++ program,
 *    or somewhat like the environment of a U*IX shell.</p>
 * <p>The main difference are:</p>
 * <ul>
 *  <li>there can be many instances of <code>Context</code> within the
 *     same Java program (unlike sets of static variables in C).</li>
 *  <li>finding objects in a <code>Context</code> is performed by specifying
 *     a Class, rather than a name.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>Generally, a context contains only one instance per object
 *    class so a lookup returns no more than one instance.</p>
 * <p>Contexts can be chained hierarchically: if a lookup in
 *    one Context does not produce a result, Contexts automatically
 *    delegate the query to their parent Context (recursively).</p>
 * <p>Contexts have names. By prepending the hierarchical name of the
 *    parent context, a hierarchical name is constructed for the context.
 *    Note that child context names do not have to be unique within a
 *    parent context.</p>
