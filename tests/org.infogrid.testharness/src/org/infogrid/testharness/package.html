      <p>Provides testing infrastructure.</p>
      <p>This is somewhat comparable to what jUnit does, except:</p>
      <ul>
          <li>we don't create funny conventions for the naming of tests</li>
          <li>our facilities make the testing of InfoGrid modules much simpler as
          they are aware of InfoGrid concepts</li>
          <li>it's integrated with the Module Framework</li>
      </ul>
