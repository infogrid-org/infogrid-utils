/**
  * <p>The role played by a EntityType in a RelationshipType. One can consider a RoleType to be the "end"
  *    of a RelationshipType.</p>
  *
  * <p>RelationshipType inheritance is modeled through RoleTypes. By allowing a RoleType to refine another
  *    RoleType, the RelationshipType is subtyped. Of course, there are constraints on the topology of
  *    such refinement relationships. Given that InfoGrid supports multiple inheritance for EntityTypes
  *    and for RelationshipTypes, any RoleType may refine N RoleTypes, which thereby identify the
  *    supertype RelationshipTypes. The top RoleType is a singleton and used by a unary RelationshipType.</p>
  *
  * <p>RoleTypes carry a multiplicity, which, counter-intuitively, is the opposite of what is commonly written
  *    next to the line in an entity-relationship or class-association diagram. For example, if this is the
  *    diagram:</p>
  * <pre>
  *    +-------+ 0..1        1..* +-------+
  *    |   A   |<---------------->|   B   |
  *    +-------+ (source)  (dest) +-------+
  * </pre>
  * <p>then the source RoleType carries the 1..*, while the destination RoleType carries the 0..1. While this is
  *    a little counter-intuitive diagrammatically, it makes a lot more sense semantically and programmatically.</p>
