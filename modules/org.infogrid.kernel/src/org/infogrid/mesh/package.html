    <title>The org.infogrid.mesh package</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>Contains the core classes and interfaces to represent
       {@link org.infogrid.mesh.MeshObject MeshObjects}.</p>
    <p>MeshObjects have zero or more properties, and may be related to each
       other.</p>
    <p>MeshObjects may be blessed and unblessed with zero or more
       {@link org.infogrid.model.primitives.EntityType EntityTypes}.
       Similarly, each relationship between any two MeshObjects may be blessed
       with zero or more
       {@link org.infogrid.model.primitives.RoleType RoleTypes}.</p>
    <p>For each type, a MeshObject may have an associated
       {@link org.infogrid.mesh.TypedMeshObjectFacade TypedMeshObjectFacade},
       which provides a type-safe way of interacting with the MeshObject.</p>
    <p>The application programmer should almost never have to deal with
       subtypes or classes implementing the concepts defined in this package.</p>
