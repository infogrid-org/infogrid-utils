/**
 * <p>A software component of an InfoGrid application's user interface.
 *    Conceptually, the user interface of an InfoGrid application consists of Viewlets.
 *    Viewlets are abstract concepts with a common API that can be implemented in a variety
 *    of technologies, including Java servlets and Java Swing components.
 * <p>A Viewlet typically has a subject, which is given as a <code>MeshObject</code>. For example,
 *    a Viewlet showing an electronic business card might have the owner of the business card
 *    as the subject.</p>
 * <p>The <code>Viewlet</code> interface is supported by all InfoGrid Viewlets. More specific
 *    subtypes are provided for specific implementation technologies, such as JSE and JEE.</p>
